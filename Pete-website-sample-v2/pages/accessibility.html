                <ul>
                    <li>Press Tab to move forward through links and form elements</li>

                <h3>Skip links</h3>
                <p>A 'Skip to main content' link appears when you first press Tab on any page. This allows you to skip past navigation and go straight to the main content.</p>

                <h3>Focus indicators</h3>
                <p>All interactive elements have a clear yellow focus indicator to show which element you are currently on when navigating with a keyboard.</p>

                <h3>Colour themes</h3>
                <p>We offer four colour theme options to help with readability and visual comfort. Your theme choice is saved automatically for future visits.</p>

                <h3>Text alternatives</h3>
                <p>All images and icons have appropriate alternative text for screen reader users. Decorative images are marked as such and ignored by screen readers.</p>

                <h3>Headings structure</h3>
                <p>All pages use a logical heading structure (H1, H2, H3) to make navigation easier for screen reader users.</p>

                <h3>Link text</h3>
                <p>All links have meaningful text that describes where they lead. We do not use 'click here' or similar vague link text.</p>
