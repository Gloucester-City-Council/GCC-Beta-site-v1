Place your Gloucester hero photograph in this folder and name it:

  gloucester-hero.jpg

Recommended content: Gloucester Cathedral, Gloucester Docks, or an aerial cityscape.
Recommended size: 1600 × 900 px minimum, saved as WebP or JPEG.
Target file size: under 300 KB for fast page load.

The image will have a semi-transparent dark navy overlay applied via CSS,
so lighter, mid-toned photographs work best.
